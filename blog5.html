            <p><strong>“How do I protect my child from the realities of the world?”</strong></p>
            <p><strong>“My kindergartener said his classmates were bullying a new student.”</strong></p>
            <p><strong>“Short stories for childrento help kids stand up to bullying...how does that work?”</strong></p>
            <p>Parents and teachers have reason to be concerned. We don’t live in a stress-free, fairytale world. We want to protect our kids from things like bullying as long as we can.</p>
            <p><strong>But how?</strong></p><br>

            <p>Welcome to The ​Adventures of Aiden​,​a series of short storieswritten especially for young children. The individual books are illustrated with engaging pictures, and each teaches one simple way that children can build strength from the inside out. These books can complement any character educationcurricula found in schools today. Together, these tools will help kids stand up to bullying as it happens while helping to develop a core foundation of inner strength.</p><br>

            <p>The Uncommon Way​, one of the short stories from The​ ​Adventures of Aiden​series, illustrates this as Aiden and his friends learn how they can change their lives—and maybe even the world—from the inside out.</p><br>

            <h5 class="blog-subheading">The Uncommon Way: A Summary</h5>

            <p>The Uncommon Way starts with a common issue for parents—a difficult question from a child. Aiden asks his dad one day why there is so much bad news, why everything that is reported on TV seems to be violent and negative. His class has been learning ways to stop bullying in school, but Aiden wants to know what will change things everywhere else.</p><br>

            <p>“You’ve got to be the change,” his dad tells him. “Some changes start inside each of us.” Soon, Aiden and his sister, Skyler, are rainstorming ways to bring positive things to their neighborhood with their friends Miguel and Zack. They teach younger kids to play baseball, read with kids who struggle with their lessons, and organize a neighborhood clean-up. Soon, their efforts attract the attention of a local reporter, which leads to other kids joining the movement.</p><br>

            <p>In other words, Aiden, Skyler, and their friends are living their lives in an uncommon way by making a difference. But how will this stop bullying?</p><br>

          <h5 class="blog-subheading">Self-Esteem: Changing From the Inside Out</h5>
          <p>Self-esteem is built by focusing on the positive things accomplished both for ourselves and for other people. Aiden, Skyler, and their friends are building positive self-esteem by helping others and seeing the results of that work. In other words, they are changing the world from the inside out. When a bully attempts to harass or control them, these children will have an inner core of strength that helps them to ignore the bully and maintain their self-esteem. This is one of the hardest things for children to do, but developing this strength of character can make an enormous difference. They learn to think, “I am valuable to myself and others, and what this person is saying just isn’t true. I’m going to deal with it in a positive way, even if that is just walking away.”</p><br>

          <p>Let’s face it: even adults face bullies. We all know it’s hard to stand up to a bully, especially if we feel bad about ourselves. We begin to believe the negative things a bully says about us and to us. It takes self-confidence to walk away or to stand up to the bully. The ncommon Way​therefore teaches children a lesson that will help them throughout life.</p><br>

          <h5 class="blog-subheading">Uncommon Solutions</h5>
          <p>Parents and teachers can use a variety of tools to help children in their care stand up to bullies. Children’s stories, like The Uncommon Way and the other stories from the Adventures of Aiden ​series, will complement a school’s character education curriculum by engaging kids through storytelling. The short stories are also reinforcing reading skills, spelling, inference, and other academic skills at the same time. Through this holistic approach, children are being educated in an uncommon and effective way.</p>

          <p>Education Weekstates that “.....character education is simply about how people treat each other, and the ideas are fairly universal. The primary traits that schools promote......are respect, responsibility, caring, fairness, and honesty.” The children in your care can learn about all these valuable traits through The Adventures of Aiden​.</p><br>
