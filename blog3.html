            <h5 class="blog-subheading">Introduction</h5>
            <p>Parents know that bullying is real. They send their kids off to school each morning hoping for the best, yet also hoping that if it isn’t, their child will come home and tell mom and dad all about it. Teachers do their best to juggle the demands of their educational curricula while also teaching character-building lessons, like those in a new program called Adventures of Aiden. Everyone students come into contact with every day has the same goal: bully-free schools that focus on learning, not bullying.</p><br>

            <p>Why, then, do we keep hearing horror stories about bullying in even the earliest grades? Is bullying among children as young as four and five years old really a problem? And is everyone talking about the same thing, anyway?</p><br>

            <h5 class="blog-subheading">Let’s Define Bullying First</h5>

            <p>It can be confusing, especially with all the media attention on bullying and its sometimes lethal consequences. If one child teases another, is that bullying? How about taking a kid’s lunch every day and threatening to hurt them if they tell?</p><br>

            <p>It’s a question that deserves to be answered. There is a lot of research on the topic of bullying, and the studies agree: It comes down to the frequency and intent of the bullying. Descriptions of bullying mention things like:</p>    

            <ul class="bullet-ul">
              <li class="bullet-listing"><i class="fas fa-circle circle-bullet"></i> Taking advantage of another individual who is physically small for their age or different in some outward way.</li>
              <li class="bullet-listing"><i class="fas fa-circle circle-bullet"></i> Attempting to gain control over the victim or a social group.</li>
              <li class="bullet-listing"><i class="fas fa-circle circle-bullet"></i> Showing repeated deliberate hostility or aggression toward a victim.</li>
              <li class="bullet-listing"><i class="fas fa-circle circle-bullet"></i> Intentionally trying to humiliate, exclude, or torment the same victim over time.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Blocking a child every day from entering the restroom until they pay an “entrance fee” is bullying. Classmates making fun of your child’s new glasses for a day or two until the novelty wears off is teasing. <br><br>

            It seems unbelievable that kids in pre-K or kindergarten intentionally torment each other. Do parents really need to worry about this, or is it media hype?</p> <br>

          <h5 class="blog-subheading">Is Bullying Really a Problem in Lower Elementary Grades?</h5>
          <p>Adventures of Aiden is geared toward pre-k and younger elementary students. But do students in that age range really have a bullying issue in the first place? Unfortunately, the statistics show that they do. BMC Public Health reports 13% of kindergarten children have been bullied and another 11% reported bullying others. An additional 4% are found to be both bullies and victims. So, yes, bullying is a problem among very small children. Further, programs designed for this age group might put a stop to the problem before it gets more dangerous as they mature. <br><br>

          As children get older, the numbers increase, with results over time including kids who refuse to go to school.  Over half of those children who are bullied at school never report it. And then we shudder at the stories about a five-year old who brings a knife to school to protect themselves.<br><br>

          Where does bullying happen? Kids who do report bullying at school say that it usually happens in classrooms (29.3%), hallways (29.0%), lunchroom (23%), bathrooms (12.2%), and playgrounds (6.2%). In other words, it can happen anywhere at school, even if adults are present.  And we can’t forget that bullying can happen with one or more delivery methods: physical, verbal, social, and now via the internet. If you are a parent, your heartbeat just picked up a bit, right, at these bullying statistics?<br><br>

          Parents are often told that the school has bullying under control. Teachers and administrators work hard to educate as well as protect the kids in their care every day. When things go wrong, though, everyone feels helpless and frustrated. What then?</p> <br>

          <h5 class="blog-subheading">The Adventures of Aiden Can Help</h5>
          <p>Good news is coming your way! The Adventures of Aiden, an anti-bullying series, focuses on the youngest school-age children in language they understand with the goal of building the inner strength of kids. The series of short stories for children is designed for parents and teachers as they share the adventures of Aiden and his sister Skyler who learn positive ways to deal with bullying. <br><br>

          All kids need to know what to do when they are bullied. But helping them build a core of inner strength — those are lessons in character that will last kids a lifetime. Join Aiden and Skyler and all their friends as they fend off bullying from the inside out in The Adventures of Aiden.</p><br>
