            <p class="blog-short-para">Bullying has become a serious problem that impacts hundreds and thousands of children across the world every day. Today, 1 out of 5 kids report a bullying case in the US. Besides, kids who experience some form of bullying are at higher risk of sleep difficulties, anxiety, and poor school performance.</p>

            <p>The burden of responsibility lies on the shoulders of parents and educators to ensure the safety of kids at school and at home. A kid with teary face coming home from school and saying, “someone hurt me,” aches the heart of every parent.<br>
            The surge in cyberbullying and in-person bullying has startled parents across the country. In fact, more than 150,000 children miss school every day due to fear of bullying alone. If parents and educators want to disrupt the escalation, they should put in place a plan of action to stop bullying for good.</p><br><br>

            <p class="bold-para">Here are some guidelines parents and educators can collectively follow as a preventive mechanism against bullying:</p>

                <h5 class="blog-subheading">Determine Signs of Possible Bullying</h5>
                <p>Kids can have more than just one reason not to speak to their teachers or parents about a bullying incident. Mostly, it is the fear of retaliation that discourages kids from speaking out. On the other hand, your kid might assume that it is how you grow up.<br><br>

                Therefore, parents and teachers should talk to the kid to not feel guilt or shame about being bullied. In most bullying cases, kids pass on clues to their parents and teachers about a bullying situation rather than speak out openly about it. Parents and educators should always be ready to look out for these signs.</p>

                <h5 class="blog-subheading">Try to Understand the Nature of Bullying</h5>
                <p>Technically, bullying could be physical or emotional abuse with varying characteristics. Often, parents and teachers can just spot physical bullying but overlook emotional bullying. Also, the nature of bullying could be intentional to physically hurt someone, or it could be verbal. <br><br>

                The repetition in bullying is another factor that could pose more issues in the years to come. Parents and educators should be knowledgeable that most of the bullying transpires because of an imbalanced power between kids.<br><br>

                Behavioral bullying is arguably the hardest to identify for parents and teachers because it can take many forms. Nonetheless, physical bullying includes pushing, poking, hitting, or kicking. Verbal bullying revolves around name-calling, taunting, yelling, threatening to hurt, or insulting.<br><br>

                Conversely, relational bullying involves spreading rumors, excluding a specific kid from a group, or encouraging someone else to hurt. However, bullying can overlap when it comes to behavioral tendencies of kids.</p>

                <h5 class="blog-subheading">Firm Knowledge about Child’s Rights</h5>
                <p>A kid can face bullying for several different reasons. It could be about a kid’s religion, race, weight, ethnic group, color, allergies, race, or disability. In a disability case, parents and teachers should be knowledgeable about the lawful rights of kids. For instance, a school that discriminates on any of the aforementioned areas can face a lawsuit. However, it is an area where teachers have to be more participative and active to prevent bullying at all costs.</p>

                <h5 class="blog-subheading">Bullying Discourse: Be More Expressive</h5>
                <p>Why wait for the confrontation when a teacher or parent can encourage kids to be more broadminded? In fact, the more expressive the parents and educators are, the less bullying will take place. The job of the parents should be to inform their kids about bullying. Once the conversation initiates, your kid would be more comfortable to talk about any bullying issue.</p>

                <h5 class="blog-subheading">Establish a Model Social Behavior for Kids</h5>
                <p>The best way to prevent kids from any form of bullying is to ensure they grow up in happy and loving relationships. Even if your kid doesn’t listen to you, parents and educators can create a healthy relationship at home and school to help kids adopt normal social behavior. <br><br>

                It is vital that parents teach their kids social skills from an early age so that they can stand for themselves. For instance, role play with your kid on how to join other kids in a playground or introduce yourself at a party.<br><br>

                Parents and teachers play an integral role when it comes to the reinforcement of positive conversion among kids. For example, teachers and educators can praise the kids and assure them that it’s normal to make mistakes.

                <h5 class="blog-subheading">Teach Kids Not to become Bystanders</h5>
                <p>There’s a high likelihood that your kid would face bullying at some point. Therefore, parents and educators should become role models and teach the kids to intervene in a bullying situation. Mostly, it just requires physically standing side-by-side with a victim to show support. Although confrontation works, instill the idea among kids to keep a safe distance from a bully.</p>

                <h5 class="blog-subheading">Don’t Take Short-Cuts</h5>
                <p>There’s no magic button for parents and educators to solve all the bullying-related problems of kids at once. It’s about taking a shared interest and involved approach that can bring normalcy to kids’ life. It all comes down to how educators and parents communicate with a child. <br><br>

                For instance, educators can introduce an anti-bullying curriculum. It could be something as simple as a few respectful steps. Again, the idea is to spread as much awareness as possible at school and at home. Educators can conduct a fun-style meeting and talk about bullying.
                </p>

            </article>

          <h5 class="blog-subheading">Conclusion</h5>
          <p>Parents and educators can always take up an initiative and talk about more options to resolve bullying issues. Alternatively, parents can also become volunteers and help their kids at school when they can. In essence, parents and educators should not exercise vague terms to convey a message when it comes to bullying. <br><br>

          And this is where Aiden Alexander’s anti-bullying 7-book series, “Only Let the Good Stuff In,” can be perfect for parents to help their kids realize their inner charm and kindness. Whether your kid is in kindergarten or 5th grade, continuously develop his or her inner power, confidence, encouragement, and communication skills. Positive changes, behavior adjustment, and attitude reinforcement only occurs when kids know that they have complete support from their teachers and parents.</p>
